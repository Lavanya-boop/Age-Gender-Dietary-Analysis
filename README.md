# Age-Gender-Dietary-Analysis

Research project analyzing how age and gender influence calorie consumption in diverse populations by Mahitha Vontimitta, Veronica Angelina Itta, and Lavanya Ranganatham.

## Research Question
Examining how age and gender affect variability in calorie consumption and their potential interactions.

## Data
- Source: [USDA FoodData Central](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/)
- Files: DEMO.CSV (demographics) and DSQTOT.CSV (dietary data)
- Variables: Age, Gender, Calories, Protein, Carbs, Fat, Fiber, Sugar, Sodium

## Methods
- Data cleaning and merging based on SEQN identifier
- Visualization: Box plots, density plots, histograms, scatter plots
- Statistical analysis: Kruskal-Wallis test, Dunn's Test, linear/logistic regression

## Key Findings
- Calories strongly correlated with fat (0.80), carbs (0.67), and protein (0.54)
- Age negatively correlated with nutritional factors
- Significant differences in calorie consumption across age groups
- Younger groups have higher calorie needs
- Males generally consume more calories than females
- Complex interaction between age and gender affects dietary patterns

## Application
- Personalized dietary guidelines based on demographics
- Targeted nutritional programs for diverse population segments
